# Pixel Art Maker Project

## Introduction
This lab will be completed as part of my Front-End Nanodegree with Udacity.  The project involves creating a one-page, interactive web application that allows users to draw a pixel image on a customizable panel grid.

## Requirements

At a *minimum*, users should be able to:
1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
2. Choose a color using an interactive HTML5 color-picker
3. Click the cells of the customizable grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

## Primary Functionality
The central task of this project involves successfully writing function, `makeGrid()` which will allow the user to dynamically set the size of and create a grid they can then interact with.

## Key Skills Developed
- Accessing DOM elements using the `document` object methods
- Define functions and append them to DOM elements as event listeners
- Code nested loops to delete and create a table based on user input
